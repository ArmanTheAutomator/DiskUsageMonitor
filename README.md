Important Notes
This script currently supports Gmailâ€™s SMTP server, but it can be modified for other email providers by updating the SMTP server and port.
Remember to safeguard your email password. This script uses getpass to keep it secure.
Troubleshooting
Authentication Error: If you receive an authentication error, ensure your email provider allows SMTP access and that the credentials are correct.
SMTP Connection Issues: Verify internet connection and email server details.
